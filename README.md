# Happy Thoughts

This project was to build our own version of Twitter called Happy-thoughts, by fetching and posting data to an API. The app is built in React.

## The problem

I started by identifing which components I needed. I started with two: one for the Form and one for the Happy thoughts. The tricky part was to get the like button to work and I soon realised I needed another component, so I created the LikeButton component. In this project I am using state and props. And using useEffect for the first time. I am happy with the result.

I am having some netlify problems. Will get back with the URL soon.
